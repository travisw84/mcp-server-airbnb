## Installation

### For Claude Desktop
This extension is packaged as an MCP Bundle (`.mcpb`) file. To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/openbnb-org/mcp-server-airbnb/releases/latest)
2. Open the file — Claude Desktop will show an installation dialog
3. Configure the extension settings as needed

To ignore robots.txt, open Claude Desktop settings, navigate to the extension, and enable the **Ignore robots.txt** toggle.

### For Cursor, etc.

Before starting make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your desktop for `npx` to work.
1. Go to: Cursor Settings > Tools & Integrations > New MCP Server

2. Add one the following to your `mcp.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "airbnb": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "@openbnb/mcp-server-airbnb"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    To ignore robots.txt for all requests, use this version with `--ignore-robots-txt` args

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "airbnb": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "@openbnb/mcp-server-airbnb",
            "--ignore-robots-txt"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
3. Restart.


## Configuration

The extension provides the following user-configurable options:

### Ignore robots.txt
- **Type**: Boolean (checkbox)
- **Default**: `false`
- **Description**: Bypass robots.txt restrictions when making requests to Airbnb
- **Recommendation**: Keep disabled unless needed for testing purposes

### Disable third-party geocoding
- **Type**: Boolean (checkbox)
- **Environment variable**: `DISABLE_GEOCODING`
- **Default**: `false`
- **Description**: Skip the Photon/Nominatim geocoding step and let Airbnb resolve the location string on its own. Enabling this restores the pre-PR behavior — every search goes only to `airbnb.com`, no third-party calls.
- **Recommendation**: Keep disabled unless you specifically need zero third-party outbound traffic. With it enabled, non-US searches could return incorrect results. See [External Services](#external-services).

### Airbnb domain
- **Type**: String
- **Environment variable**: `AIRBNB_BASE_URL`
- **Default**: `https://www.airbnb.com`
- **Description**: The Airbnb domain to query. Airbnb runs a per-country domain (`airbnb.co.uk`, `airbnb.fr`, …) and hands requests off to the one matching your request origin, so from some regions `www.airbnb.com` never returns a page the server can parse. Point this at your country domain to query it directly.
- **Recommendation**: Leave unset unless searches fail with a domain-handoff error. See [Country domains](#country-domains).

## Tools

### `airbnb_search`

Search for Airbnb listings with comprehensive filtering options.

**Parameters:**
- `location` (required): Location to search (e.g., "San Francisco, CA"). When supplied without `placeId`, the server geocodes this string client-side via Photon/Nominatim — see [External Services](#external-services).
- `placeId` (optional): Google Maps Place ID. Overrides `location` and skips client-side geocoding entirely (no third-party calls).
- `checkin` (optional): Check-in date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `checkout` (optional): Check-out date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `adults` (optional): Number of adults (default: 1)
- `children` (optional): Number of children (default: 0)
- `infants` (optional): Number of infants (default: 0)
- `pets` (optional): Number of pets (default: 0)
- `minPrice` (optional): Minimum price per night
- `maxPrice` (optional): Maximum price per night
- `cursor` (optional): Pagination cursor for browsing results
- `propertyType` (optional): Filter by property type — `entire_home`, `private_room`, `shared_room`, or `hotel_room`
- `ignoreRobotsText` (optional): Override robots.txt for this request

**Returns:**
- Search results with property details, pricing, and direct links
- Pagination information for browsing additional results
- Search URL for reference

### `airbnb_listing_details`

Get detailed information about a specific Airbnb listing.

**Parameters:**
- `id` (required): Airbnb listing ID
- `checkin` (optional): Check-in date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `checkout` (optional): Check-out date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `adults` (optional): Number of adults (default: 1)
- `children` (optional): Number of children (default: 0)
- `infants` (optional): Number of infants (default: 0)
- `pets` (optional): Number of pets (default: 0)
- `ignoreRobotsText` (optional): Override robots.txt for this request

**Returns:**
- Detailed property information including:
  - Location details with coordinates
  - Amenities and facilities, as `seeAllAmenitiesGroups` — an object keyed by amenity category, so a category can be addressed directly. Amenities Airbnb shows struck through arrive under its own `"Not included"` category:

    ```json
    {
      "seeAllAmenitiesGroups": {
        "Bathroom": "Hair dryer",
        "Heating and cooling": "AC - split type ductless system, Heating",
        "Not included": "Dryer, Hot water"
      }
    }
    ```
  - House rules and policies
  - Property highlights and descriptions
  - Direct link to the listing

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) via stdio transport
- **Format**: MCP Bundle (MCPB) v0.3
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies for security and reliability

### External Services

In addition to `airbnb.com`, the server makes geocoding requests to two third-party services to translate location queries into accurate map bounding boxes. This bypasses Airbnb's own server-side geocoder, which produces incorrect results for many non-US queries (e.g. "Paris, France" lands in Vendée; "Copenhagen, Denmark" lands in Wisconsin).

| Service | Endpoint | Used for | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Photon](https://photon.komoot.io/) | `photon.komoot.io` | Primary geocoder, called on every search without `placeId` | Free OSM-based service hosted by Komoot. One request per search. |
| [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) | `nominatim.openstreetmap.org` | Fallback geocoder, called only when Photon does not return a bounding box | Subject to the [OSMF usage policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/) (max ~1 req/sec). |

Each search sends only the `location` string from the request to the geocoder — no other request fields, no IP geolocation, no tracking identifiers. The location string itself is, of course, the same string the user typed.

**Opting out:** there are two ways to skip the geocoders:

- **Per-request:** supply an explicit `placeId`. When `placeId` is present, the server uses Airbnb's own place lookup directly with no third-party calls.
- **Globally:** set the environment variable `DISABLE_GEOCODING=true`. The server will skip Photon/Nominatim entirely and pass the raw location string to Airbnb. This restores the pre-PR behavior for every search and guarantees zero third-party outbound traffic — at the cost of broken results for non-US locations that Airbnb's own geocoder mishandles. Defaults to `false`.

If a geocoder is unreachable or returns no result, the server falls back to sending the location string to Airbnb directly, exactly as it did before — so the worst case for an outage is that international searches degrade to the previous (broken) behavior, not that the search fails entirely.

### Country domains

Airbnb runs a separate domain per country (`airbnb.co.uk`, `airbnb.fr`, …) and hands requests off to the one matching the request origin. When that happens, `www.airbnb.com` does not return the page you asked for — it returns a ~1KB stub that POSTs to `/v2/domain_switch/handoff` via JavaScript:

```html
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
<form method="POST" action="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/v2/domain_switch/handoff">
```

It arrives as HTTP 200 rather than a 3xx, so no HTTP client follows it, and it contains none of the data the server parses. Requesting the same path on the country domain returns the full page normally.

The server detects this stub and reports it explicitly, naming the domain Airbnb wants to use:

```
Airbnb handed this request off to its www.airbnb.co.uk country domain instead of
serving <url>, so there was no page to parse. Set
AIRBNB_BASE_URL=https://www.airbnb.co.uk to query that domain directly.
```

Setting [`AIRBNB_BASE_URL`](#airbnb-domain) resolves it for both `airbnb_search` and `airbnb_listing_details`. The default is unchanged, so this only affects setups that hit the handoff.

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error logging with timestamps
- Graceful degradation when Airbnb's page structure changes
- Country-domain handoffs reported distinctly, rather than as a page-structure change
- Timeout protection for network requests
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting

### Security Measures
- Robots.txt compliance by default
- Request timeout limits
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure environment variable handling
- No sensitive data storage

### Performance
- Efficient HTML parsing with Cheerio
- Request caching where appropriate
- Minimal memory footprint
- Fast startup and response times

## Compatibility

- **Platforms**: macOS, Windows, Linux
- **Node.js**: 18.0.0 or higher
- **Claude Desktop**: 0.10.0 or higher
- **Other MCP clients**: Compatible with any MCP-supporting application

## Development

### Building from Source

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Watch for changes during development
npm run watch
```

### Testing

```bash
# Build, then run all three suites
npm test
```

`npm test` runs one offline unit suite, then drives the built server over stdio and calls the tools for real:

- `test-domain-handoff.js` — country-domain handoff detection against a captured stub, including the cases that must *not* be treated as a handoff. No network required
- `test-extension.js` — MCP handshake, tool listing, a search, listing details, and the geocoding paths (Photon, Nominatim fallback)
- `test-amenities.js` — amenity extraction across several live listings, checking that amenities Airbnb strikes through never appear as ones the listing offers

The latter two hit `airbnb.com` and the geocoders over the network, so they need connectivity and can fail if Airbnb changes its page structure — that's the point of them, but it also means they aren't suitable as an unattended CI gate. They also assume `airbnb.com` serves you a parseable page; from a region where Airbnb hands off to a country domain, set `AIRBNB_BASE_URL` before running them. `test-domain-handoff.js` is offline and deterministic, so it is safe in CI.

The server can also be run directly:

```bash
# Run with robots.txt compliance (default)
node dist/index.js

# Run with robots.txt ignored (for testing)
node dist/index.js --ignore-robots-txt

# Run against a country domain (see Country domains)
AIRBNB_BASE_URL=https://www.airbnb.co.uk node dist/index.js
```
